Google Account Creation - Device Tracking

When a Gmail (Google) account is created, Google automatically records:
- The device type (e.g., phone, PC, tablet).
- Operating system and browser version.
- IP address, which can show the approximate location.
- Unique device identifiers or fingerprints.

Why does Google do this?
- For security and fraud detection.
- To alert you if a login happens from an unusual device or location.

Can anyone else see this?
- No. Only Google internally has this data.
- Others cannot see which device you used unless they gain access to your Google account.

How to check your own devices:
1. Sign in to your Google Account.
2. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
3. Under "Your devices," you can view and manage all devices that have accessed your account.
